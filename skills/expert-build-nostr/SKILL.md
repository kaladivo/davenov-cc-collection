## How Nostr Works

Nostr is a decentralized protocol for real-time data exchange. Understanding these fundamentals is critical for every implementation.

### 1. Events Are Everything

The entire protocol has ONE data type: the Event. Every piece of data - messages, profiles, reactions, custom app data - is an Event with this structure:

```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string        // SHA256 hash of serialized event
  pubkey: string    // 32-byte hex public key of creator
  created_at: number // Unix timestamp (seconds)
  kind: number      // Event type (0-65535)
  tags: string[][]  // Array of tag arrays
  content: string   // Payload (often JSON stringified)
  sig: string       // Schnorr signature
}
```

Every event is cryptographically signed. Authenticity is verified by signature, not by the relay.

### 2. Kind Numbers Define Behavior

Kind numbers determine how relays store events and how clients interpret them:

| Range | Type | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| 0, 3, 10000-19999 | Replaceable | Only latest per pubkey+kind stored |
| 1, 2, 4-44, 1000-9999 | Regular | All stored permanently |
| 20000-29999 | Ephemeral | NOT stored - real-time only |
| 30000-39999 | Addressable | Latest per pubkey+kind+d-tag stored |

**For data exchange between apps:** Use ephemeral kinds (20000-29999) for transient messages, addressable kinds (30000+) for stateful data.

### 3. Relays Are Dumb Pipes

Relays are WebSocket servers that store and forward events. They:
- Accept events via `["EVENT", <event>]`
- Return events via subscriptions `["REQ", <sub_id>, <filter>...]`
- Do NOT communicate with each other
- Do NOT guarantee delivery or storage

**Your app must handle:** Multiple relay connections, deduplication, retry logic, and failure scenarios.

### 4. Subscriptions Are Filters

Clients subscribe to events using filter objects:

```typescript
interface Filter {
  ids?: string[]      // Specific event IDs
  authors?: string[]  // Pubkeys to match
  kinds?: number[]    // Event kinds
  since?: number      // Events after timestamp
  until?: number      // Events before timestamp
  limit?: number      // Max events to return
  "#e"?: string[]     // Events with these e-tags
  "#p"?: string[]     // Events mentioning these pubkeys
  "#<letter>"?: string[] // Any single-letter tag
}
```

### 5. Use nostr-tools for JavaScript/TypeScript

The canonical library is `nostr-tools`. Key imports:

```typescript
// Key generation and signing
import { generateSecretKey, getPublicKey, finalizeEvent, verifyEvent } from 'nostr-tools/pure'

// Relay pool management
import { SimplePool } from 'nostr-tools/pool'

// NIP-19 encoding (npub, nsec, etc.)
import * as nip19 from 'nostr-tools/nip19'

// NIP-44 encryption
import * as nip44 from 'nostr-tools/nip44'
```

### 6. Security Is Non-Negotiable

- NEVER expose secret keys in client-side code or logs
- ALWAYS verify event signatures before trusting data
- Use NIP-44 (not NIP-04) for encryption - NIP-04 is deprecated and insecure
- Store keys securely (use NIP-46 remote signing for web apps)

<intake>
**What would you like to do?**

1. Set up a new Nostr client/application
2. Implement pub/sub messaging between apps
3. Create custom event kinds for app data
4. Add encrypted communication (DMs, private data)
5. Connect to and manage relays
6. Debug relay/event issues
7. Something else

**Wait for response, then read the matching workflow.**

## After Every Change

```bash
# 1. TypeScript compiles?
npx tsc --noEmit

# 2. Can connect to relays?
# Test with a known relay like wss://relay.damus.io

# 3. Events properly signed?
# Use verifyEvent() on created events

# 4. Subscriptions receiving data?
# Check EOSE message received
```

Report:
- "Build: OK" / "Build: X errors"
- "Relay connection: OK to X relays"
- "Event signing: Valid"
- "Subscription: Receiving events"
