# Update Davenov CC Collection

This command updates the **davenov-cc** npm package — a collection of Claude Code skills and slash commands — to the latest version and syncs them to your `~/.claude/` folder.

## Instructions

Run the npx command to fetch and install the latest version:

```bash
npx davenov-cc@latest
```

The `@latest` tag ensures npm fetches the newest version, bypassing any cached versions.

Report the results to the user.
